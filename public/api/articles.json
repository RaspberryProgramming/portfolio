The print command is simple in it's usage. First you want to open a python interpreter. Next type the following: `print('Hello World')` After that you Hello World printed to the screen.

            "contents":"*Steganography*Steganography is the art or practice of concealing a message, image or file within another message, image or file. There are many techniques to perform steganography, one of which is to hide messages on physical paper in the physical world. Another technique involves hiding messages in digital images or digital data, also called digital messages. Images are the typical victim used to hide information. Social steganography is when messages are hidden in the title and context of a video or image. Names or words may be misspelled that are popular in a given time to suggest alternative meanings, or pictures can be traced by paint or drawing tools. When information is hidden in telecommunication networks, this is called network steganography. Today steganography is mostly done on computers with tools such as steghide, stegstudio and more. One simple way of doing so is on linux, by combining a zip file and an image in order to hide the in the back part of the image file.*Hiding Files Inside of a JPG File* You can first download an image that you'd like to use. Next, you'll create a file to hide. You can use anything, given that it can be hidden within a zip. I'm using a text file called steg.txt. Next, you'll want to compress the file. You can do this in the terminal by running the following. `zip zipfile.zip steg.txt` Now that you have a zip file you can now hide the file. We'll do this by using the cat command. This command will combine the data within two files, and allow us to create a new file with the data concatenated. Run the following command using image.jpg as our image file and zipfile as the zip we just created. If you have a file with a different file extension (I.E. .jpg, .png) change StegFile.jpg to reflect this change in addition to the original image file. `cat image.jpg zipfile.zip > StegFile.jpg` Now that everything is combined, you can attempt to view the StegFile.jpg image to see if you've correctly combined the two files. If you'd like to get the files out of the zip/steg file, you can then run the following on the image. `unzip StegFile.jpg` As you can see, it just unzipped the steg.txt from the image and placed it in the current directory. *Conclusion* Steganography is an interesting concept, especially revolving computer forensics and can be used to hide files and make interesting puzzles. *Sources* ~ https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steganography ~ ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography#Techniques ~ ~ http://steghide.sourceforge.net/ ~ ~ http://stegstudio.sourceforge.net/ ~"
